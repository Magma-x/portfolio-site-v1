# 🧠 Scarcastic Portfolio Developer Site

Welcome to the most *unnecessarily sarcastic* portfolio you'll ever witness on the internet. It's a single-page React-based developer site that's more than just a resume — it's an experience. Whether you're here to *judge my coding skills* or *steal ideas*, this site has everything you never asked for — but probably need.

## 🤹 About the Project

This isn't just a portfolio. It's a full-blown sarcastic showcase of skills, projects, testimonials, and developer angst — all crammed into one single-page application. Built for laughs, groans, and maybe, *just maybe*, a job offer.

## 🚀 Features

- 👋 A “Good Here” section (yes, that's actually what it's called)
- 🧠 Skills Section (because I have some)
- 💼 Project Highlights (look at what I did instead of socializing)
- 🤡 About Me (I’m a hoot)
- 🗣️ Testimonial Section (yes, people actually said nice things)
- 📬 Contact Form (please use it, I’m begging)
- 🌈 Overflowing with humor and sarcasm

## 👨‍💻 Contributors

Just me. A lone dev with a dream, a keyboard, and an unhealthy relationship with sarcasm.

But you’re welcome to fork, contribute, or just star the repo to boost my ego.

## 📜 License

MIT — because sharing is caring (and legal stuff is boring).
